# World Happiness Trends

Have you ever thought about world happiness trends? Upon finding the data available in Kaggle.com, our team was determined to analyze World Happiness data from 2015 through 2019 to discover the key factors that inspire happiness around the globe. We wanted to know the top happiest countries and how happiness varied per region around the world. 

### Questions

1. What are the top 20 happiest countries in the world?
2. What key factors inspire happiness in each region of the world? 
3. How does the happiness score differ per region?
4. How have happiness factors changed over the years from 2015 through 2019? 

### Hypothese 

- In today’s rapidly changing world, we would think that money might easily be one of the main reasons that contribute to people’s happiness, we’ll proceed with an analysis on the data to find out.

- Developed countries are happier. 

### Tools and Libraries

- Excel - Comma Separated Values (CSV) file
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

### Project Description

- Use Pandas to clean and format the World Happiness dataset(s) from 2015 to 2019. 
- Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
- Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
- Use Matplotlib to create a total of 8 visualizations of data. 
- Summarize our major findings. 

### Conclusions/Implications

Based on the scatter plots and our findings, we can see that GDP has the highest correlation with the Happiness Score, and is one of the main reasons for people’s happiness, but Health (Life Expectancy) and Family (Social Support) are almost as important factors as the GDP.  So, we can say that money is important, but we also have to feel supported by family and society around, as well as remain healthy, in order to sustain the maximum degree of happiness.

Based on our analysis, developed countries project higher happiness scores than underdeveloped countries according to the top 20 countries, ranging above the 7.0 Happiness Score from years 2015 through 2019.

Based on our analysis, developing countries project lower happiness scores than developed countries according to the bottom 20 countries, ranging below the 5.0 Happiness Score from years 2015 through 2019.
